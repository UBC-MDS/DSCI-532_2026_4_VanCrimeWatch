# Contributing to VanCrimeWatch

Contributions of all kinds are welcome for the VanCrimeWatch and are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Branching and Workflow

This project follows a Github Flow Workflow.

- The main branch always contains stable, production-ready code
- Direct commits to the 'main' branch are prohibited.
- All work should be conducted on short-lived branches created from 'main'.
- Branches should be named using appropriate prefixes such as 'feat-' or 'fix-'.
- Changes must be proposed via pull request to the main branch.
- Each Pull request must be reviewed by at least one other team member and granted approval before merging. 

## Example Contributions

You can contribute in many ways, for example:

* [Report bugs](#report-bugs)
* [Fix Bugs](#fix-bugs)
* [Implement Features](#implement-features)
* [Write Documentation](#write-documentation)
* [Submit Feedback](#submit-feedback)

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_532_2026_4_VanCrimeWatch/issues.

**If you are reporting a bug, please follow the template guidelines. The more
detailed your report, the easier and thus faster we can help you.**

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything labelled with `bug` and
`help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. When you decide to work on such
an issue, please assign yourself to it and add a comment that you'll be working on that,
too. If you see another issue without the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the
maintainers are usually happy for any support that they can get.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything labelled with
`enhancement` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. As
for [fixing bugs](#fix-bugs), please assign yourself to the issue and add a comment that
you'll be working on that, too. If another enhancement catches your fancy, but it
doesn't have the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the maintainers are usually
happy for any support that they can get.

### Write Documentation

data_fixr could always use more documentation, whether as
part of the official documentation, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog
posts, articles, and such. Just
[open an issue](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_532_2026_4_VanCrimeWatch/issues)
to let us know what you will be working on so that we can provide you with guidance.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_532_2026_4_VanCrimeWatch/issues. If your feedback fits the format of one of
the issue templates, please use that. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven
project and everybody has limited time.
