## Motivation and Purpose 

Our role: Data Analysts at the Vancouver Police Department
Target Audience: Prospective business owners and entrepreneurs who are hoping to open a business in the Vancouver area.

The process of opening a business involves many important decision making steps, with choice of location being a major one. Understanding neighborhood activity is critical not only for identifying whether the business will attract their target customer demographic, but also, to determine the safety risks that could impact employees, customers and business operations. To do this, business owners often have to conduct risk assessments by sifting through a large dataset of past incident reports, which is very time consuming and resource-intensive. Instead, it becomes much more efficient for them to visualize and examine this information in one place. Therefore, to address this challenge, we propose building an interactive dashboard illustrating crime patterns across Vancouver neighborhoods. The dashboard will show the city's crime hotspots, alongside informative temporal trends of crime activity from the past 3 years (2023-2025). In addition to this, business owners will be able to view the distribution of business-relevant crime types through filterable charts, giving them the ability to conduct side by side neighbourhood comparisons on the types of crime they view to be more important than others. This tool will allow them to efficiently account for safety risks specific to their business needs, and make more more informed data-driven location decisions.
